# fun-problem

given a conversion table, write a program that can convert any unit to any other unit
your program has to be able to take any conversation table as input as a string, parse it, and it has to be able to convert any unit to any other unit
for example, let's say you are given the following conversion table:
```
1 m = 100 cm
1 m = 3.3 ft
2 ft = 24 in
1 yd = 3 ft
10 in = 254 mm
```
can you find a way to convert `500 mm` to `yards`?
